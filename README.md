# Use-Cases-Using-Yahoo-Finance-Data
This is a repository which I maintain to document the use cases that one can build using the publicly available yahoo finance data which can be pulled using yfinance library. Different files cater different use cases like portfolio assessment, alpha beta of stocks, strategy backtesting & looped data pull for multiple tickers at once.

Files:
1. **nifty_hourly_1228_EXCEL.csv.xlsx** - Hourly Nifty data which helps user in decision making around options buying.
2. **Portfolio Analysis Tool.ipynb** - Analyze portfolio - it's current size, components and profit/loss based on user input of ticker, price & qty.
3. **Stock_Ticker_Data_Pull-_Looping_v1-Copy1.ipynb** - A looping tool to pull data on multiple stock tickers simulateously.
4. **Strategy Backtesting (WIP)** - Test strategies on Hourly Nifty data to find out expected profit/loss & variability around it for a long period and continous experimentation.
5. **Alpha Beta (WIP)** - Test the excess returns of stock/basket of stocks against benchmark (index). Also checks variability in the stock vis-a-vis other benchmarks.
