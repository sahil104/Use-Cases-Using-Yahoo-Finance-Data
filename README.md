# Use-Cases-Using-Yahoo-Finance-Data
This is a repository which I maintain to document the use cases that one can build using the publicly available yahoo finance data which can be pulled using yfinance library. Different files cater different use cases like portfolio assessment, alpha beta of stocks, strategy backtesting & looped data pull for multiple tickers at once.
